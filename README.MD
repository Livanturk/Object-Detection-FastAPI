# Object Detection API with FastAPI and OpenCV DNN

This project allows you to perform object detection using a pre-trained MobileNet model wrapped in a FastAPI backend. It returns annotated images with bounding boxes drawn over detected objects.

## 🚀 Features
- FastAPI server for REST API access
- Uses OpenCV's DNN module and MobileNet SSD model
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## ⚙️ Requirements (without Docker)
```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

## 🐳 Run with Docker
```bash
docker build -t object-detection-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 object-detection-app
```
